**Hey there! I'm Christos.**

I have worked as a Cloud DevOps Engineer at [Performance Technologies](https://www.performance.gr/) for over about a year now, while also being an undergraduate student at [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications NKUA](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en).

If someone asked me to describe myself in two words, then those would be *curious improver*. Whenever I come across something new, I am curious to learn more about it and improve my knowledge of it. Therefore, I aim for this blog to be my personal knowledge base where I am writing down my thoughts and experiments all-round GitHub, Azure, Kubernetes and many more.

**Note:** The opinions expressed herein are my own and do not represent my employerâ€™s view in any way.
