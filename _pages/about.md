**Hey there! I'm Christos.**

A little bit about myself. I have worked as a Cloud DevOps Engineer at [Performance Technologies](https://www.performance.gr/) for over about a year now, while also being an undergraduate student at [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications NKUA](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en).

If someone asked me to describe myself in two words, then those would be *curious improver*. Whenever I come across something new, I am curious to learn more about it and improve my knowledge of it. Therefore, I aim for this blog to be my personal knowledge base where I am writing down my thoughts and experiments all-around GitHub, Azure, Kubernetes and many more.

I hope that you find the content both useful and entertaining. So, without further ado [let's get started]({{ site.url }}).
