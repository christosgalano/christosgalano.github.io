excerpt: "A little bit about the author."

**Hey there! I'm Christos.**

A little bit about myself. I have worked as a Cloud DevOps Engineer at [Performance Technologies](https://www.performance.gr/) for over about a year now, while also being an undergraduate student at [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications NKUA](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en).

If someone asked me to describe myself in two words, then those would be *curious improver*. Whenever I come across something new, I am curious to learn more about it and improve my knowledge of it. As a result, I intend for this blog to serve as my personal knowledge base, where I will record my thoughts and experiments related to GitHub, GitOps, Azure, Kubernetes, and other technologies.

I hope that you find the content both useful and entertaining. So without further ado, grab yourself a cup of coffee and [let's begin]({{ site.url }}).
