## General

As an engineer who spends a significant amount of time on the internet, I have come to rely on a number of browser extensions to make my online experience more efficient and enjoyable. In this post, I will share some of my favorites with you.

## Azure Mask

One of my must-have extensions is [Azure Mask](https://github.com/clarkio/azure-mask). As the name suggests, this extension helps users protect their sensitive information when using Azure services. Azure Mask is designed to help users protect this sensitive information by automatically masking it when it is displayed in Azure portals and logs. This can help prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information and improve the overall security of Azure services. Overall, Azure Mask is a valuable tool to protect our sensitive data, especially in scenarios when we are creating content or sharing our screen.

## Gitako

Another extension that I find incredibly useful is [Gitako](https://github.com/EnixCoda/Gitako). With Gitako, we can view our repository list, search for specific repositories, and open them in a new tab with just a few clicks. The extension also allows us to view notifications, open issues, and access other features of GitHub without having to leave the current webpage. If you are using GitHub regularly like myself, then Gitako is a valuable tool for you as it allows you to easily access and manage repositories without having to constantly switch between tabs, contributing to a better GitHub experience overall.

## GitZip

A third extension that I have come to rely on is [GitZip](https://gitzip.org/). This extension allows us to easily download individual files or entire directories from a GitHub repository. With GitZip, we can simply click on the extension icon, select the files or directories we want to download, and the extension will generate a zip file containing the selected items. This can be especially useful for downloading large or complex repositories, as it allows us to easily download only the specific files or directories we need, rather than having to clone the entire repository.

## GitHub Repo Size

[GitHub Repo Size](https://github.com/harshjv/github-repo-size) is an extension that allows users to quickly and easily view the size of their GitHub repositories. Using this extension, we can simply click on the extension icon, select the repository we want to check the size of, and the extension will display the size of the repository in a pop-up window. This can be useful for tracking the growth of a repository over time, or determining which repositories are taking up the most space. The extension is simple and easy to use, and it can be a valuable tool for anyone who wants to keep an eye on the size of their repositories on GitHub.

## GitHub Markdown Printer

For anyone who frequently downloads Markdown files, I highly recommend [GitHub Markdown Printer](https://github.com/jerry1100/github-markdown-printer) which allows us to print Markdown files from our GitHub repositories in a clean and easy-to-read format. In this way, we can quickly and easily print any Markdown file from our repository, including Readme files, documentation, and other important documents. The extension converts the markdown into a printer-friendly format, removing any unnecessary elements and ensuring that the final output is easy to read. This can be especially useful for printing long or complex documents, as it ensures that the output is clear and organized.

## GitHub Isometric Contributions

[GitHub Isometric Contributions](https://github.com/jasonlong/isometric-contributions) is an extension that allows users to view their contribution activity on GitHub in a fun and visually appealing way. With this extension, we can see our contribution activity represented as an isometric pixel art grid, with each pixel representing a contribution. The grid is color-coded, with different colors representing different days of the week, so we can quickly and easily see when they were most active. This extension is a great way to add some personality and style to your GitHub profile, and can be a fun way to track your contribution activity.

## GitHub Material Icons

Being a big [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) fan i would like to simulate as much as possible my current VS Code file setup in GitHub. This is where [GitHub Material Icons](https://github.com/Claudiohbsantos/github-material-icons-extension) comes into play. This extension adds Material Design icons to various elements of a GitHub repository, such as the file tree, commit messages, and issue labels. Material Design is a design language developed by Google, and it is known for its clean, modern aesthetic. So, we can make a repository look more modern and stylish, and add some visual interest to the pages of a repository.
