## General

Hello, fellow Azure and Kubernetes enthusiasts! In this blog series we will explore how we can deploy a blue/green Kubernetes environment using the Azure Kubernetes Service. There will be 3 posts in the following sequence:

- [**Part 0: Introduction**]({% post_url 2023-xx-yy-blue-green-aks-introduction %})

- **Part 1: Architecture**

- **Part 2: Usage**

## Blue/Green Deployment

Blue/green deployment is a software deployment strategy that involves running two identical production environments, called blue and green. At any given time, only one of the environments is live and serving production traffic, while the other is idle and can be used for testing or as a failover in case of an issue with the live environment.

One of the main benefits of blue/green deployment is that it allows for minimal downtime during the deployment process. When a new version of an application is ready to be deployed, it is first tested in the idle green environment. Once the green environment has been tested and is confirmed to be working correctly, traffic is switched over from the blue environment to the green environment. This switchover can be done quickly, allowing for a seamless transition from one version of the application to the next with minimal disruption to users.

Another advantage of blue/green deployment is the ability to easily roll back to a previous version of the application if necessary. If there are any issues with the new version of the application running in the green environment, traffic can be quickly switched back to the blue environment, which is running the previous version of the application. This allows for a quick resolution of any issues that may arise during the deployment process.

Blue/green deployment is also useful in environments where it is important to minimize risk. By running two identical production environments, it is possible to ensure that there is always a failover option available in case of an issue with the live environment.

Overall, blue/green deployment is a useful tool for minimizing downtime and risk during the deployment of applications. It can be used in a variety of different environments and is particularly well-suited for applications that require a high level of availability.
