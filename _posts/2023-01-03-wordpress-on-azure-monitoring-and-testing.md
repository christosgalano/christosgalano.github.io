Hello, fellow Azure enthusiasts! In todayâ€™s blog post, we set up monitoring and testing for our WordPress site.

## Set up monitoring

### Activate the Application Insights plugin

* Go to the Application Insights resource and copy its Instrumentation Key

{% raw %}![get-instrumentation-key]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wordpress-on-azure/get-instrumentation-key.png){% endraw %}

* Login to WordPress at <https://{{app-service-name}}.azurewebsites.net/login>

* Go to Plugins, install and activate the **Application Insights** plugin

{% raw %}![install-plugin]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wordpress-on-azure/install-plugin.png){% endraw %}

* Go to **Settings -> Application Insights** and set the Instrumentation Key

{% raw %}![set-instrumentation-key]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wordpress-on-azure/set-instrumentation-key.png){% endraw %}

* Wait 5 minutes for the integration to take place

## Perform some tests

### Enable the Availability Test

The ***web_test*** module was included in the ***main*** deployment template. The specified module creates a standard availability test that performs a GET request to our WordPress site from various locations periodically. If the responses have a status code of 200, they are considered successful; otherwise, they are not. In order to enable this test:

* Go to the Application Insights resource and select the **Availability** tab

* Click on the test and enable it

{% raw %}![enable-availability-test]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wordpress-on-azure/enable-availability-test.png){% endraw %}

### Perform a Load Test

* Go to the Azure Load Testing resource that was created

* On the **Upload a JMeter script** option, click **Create**

* For the **Test Plan** provide the **tests/load_test_wordpress.jmx**

* In the **Monitoring** tab click **Add/Modify** and select the Application Insights resource that is connected to the WebApp

* On all the other tabs, provide the desired values

* Create and run the load test

{% raw %}![load-test-results]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wordpress-on-azure/load-test-results.png){% endraw %}

## Teardown the infrastructure using the *destroy.yaml* workflow

### Approve teardown

* In order to destroy the infrastructure, we first require some approvals using the following action:

```yaml
- name: Manual Workflow Approval
  uses: trstringer/manual-approval@v1.6.0
  with:
    # All approvers must be contributors in the repository
    approvers: approver-1,approver-2,...,approver-N  # use commas with no space inbetween
    minimum-approvals: x
    secret: ${{ github.TOKEN }}
```

* This action will open up an ***Issue***, where "x approvers" must respond in a positive manner (as mentioned in the issue's description) in order to proceed to the next step

* If at least one approver responds negatively, the workflow fails

{% raw %}![approve-teardown]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wordpress-on-azure/approve-teardown.png){% endraw %}

### Destroy the infrastructure

```yaml
- name: Azure Login
  uses: Azure/login@v1
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}

- name: Delete the resource group and all of its resources
  uses: Azure/cli@v1
  with:
    inlineScript: az group delete -n $RG_NAME -y
```
